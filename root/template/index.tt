<h4>about me</h4>
<p>I am a programmer working for <a href="http://iinteractive.com">Infinity Interactive</a>, mostly doing web development in Perl.</p>
<p>I typically go by "<a href="profiles.html">doy</a>" on the internet.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://github.com/doy">write</a> <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/DOY">lots</a> <a href="http://git.shadowcat.co.uk/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=gitmo/Moose.git;a=shortlog">of</a> <a href="http://crawl-ref.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=crawl-ref/crawl-ref;a=shortlog">code</a>, but there is also <a href="projects-todo.txt">a great deal of code that I haven't written yet</a>.</p>
<p>I graduated from <a href="http://uiuc.edu/">the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> in 2008, with a degree in computer science.</p>
<p>I'm currently living in Chicago, IL, but I enjoy driving all over the place (and <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/doy/">meeting new people when I do so</a>).</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy <a href="skydiving.html">skydiving</a>, playing (and writing code for) <a href="http://crawl.develz.org">Crawl</a>, and pretending I know how to cook.</p>
<p>I'm pretty obsessive about configuring things - if you're looking for example configuration files for various applications, you can see my dotfiles <a href="http://github.com/doy/conf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I listen to <a href="http://last.fm/user/doyster">a ton of music</a>, and I'm always interested in new recommendations.</p>
